This project is a Restaurant Billing System developed using Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The program simulates the basic working of a restaurant where customers can view the menu, place orders, cancel items, and generate a bill. The Restaurant class stores restaurant details and menu items, while customer objects handle individual orders. The project uses class variables, instance variables, constructors, class methods, static methods, and instance methods to manage billing operations efficiently. Each customer is assigned a unique bill number, and the total bill amount and number of items are updated dynamically based on orders and cancellations. This project is useful for beginners to understand real-world application of OOP concepts in Python.
